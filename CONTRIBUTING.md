# Contributing

Controbutions are very much welcomed. In fact, this repository lives from creative proposals on how to make use of the ability to create custom collections.

## Tutorial

If you don't know how to create custom collections, but want to learn about it, have a look at [this tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/139591/building-custom-collection-swift).

## Issues

There are two cases where you may want to open up an issue:
- To discuss a suggestion for a new collection.
- Report issues with / suggest improvements for existing collections.

## Pull Requests

When creating pull requests to fix / improve existing collections or to add new collections, it's always a good idea to first open up an issue that can then be referenced in the PR description. However, this isn't a fixed requirement.

## Guidelines

Please obey these guidelines:
- For **commit messages**:
    - Follow the syntax described [here](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- For **new collections** stick to the following structure:
    - In the `Collections` folder, add a new folder named the same as your collection.
    - In the newly created folder, add the collection source file and a doc file. Please use the [DocTemplate.md](https://github.com/piknotech/SwiftCollections/blob/stable/DocTemplate.md) file at the root of this repository as a template for any documentation file and keep its structure as far as possible.
    - Add any helper types or extensions shared between multiple collections in the `Helpers` folder.
    - Add test files to the `Tests/Sources` folder and make them a member of the `Tests` target.
- For **new files or modifications**:
    - Follow the file structure guide described [here](http://bestpractices.jamitlabs.com/t/file-structure-use-of-mark/84)
    - Use extensions for protocol conformances.
    - Don't produce any SwiftLint warnings or errors.
    - Write expressive tests covering any edited / newly created code.
    - Within the `Collections`, `Helpers` and `Tests/Sources` folders, sort things alphabetically.
- For **file headers** in Swift source files, use the following format:
```swift
//
//  [File Title].swift
//  SwiftCollections[Tests]
//
//  Created by [Your Name] on [Day (2 digits)].[Month (2 digits)].[Year (2 digits)].
//  Copyright Â© 2018 Piknotech. All rights reserved.
